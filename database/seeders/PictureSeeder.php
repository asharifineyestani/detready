The sky is blue, and it seems like a perfect day for flying a helicopter. It looks like all the firefighters are wearing their full uniforms including a helmet and glasses. A few of them are chatting casually while the others are taking some items out of the chopper.

The man's cart has two wheels with a large green umbrella in good condition covering it all. Because of the takeout containers wrapped up in plastic bags, blue beverage jug and colorful menu, he is likely a street food vendor. The vendor's tie-dye tee shirt, black cargo shorts and orange sandals hint at how hot the weather might be here despite the rainfall. This leafy street looks quite attractive with no apparent potholes in the pavement and what seems to be a row of pleasant, casual restaurants up on the sidewalk. The function of the red metal box on the left is unclear, but it must have some utility for the neighborhood. Another umbrella, probably attached to an outside dining table, has been collapsed and tied up.",

Because of the man's red backpack, it can be inferred that he is on a day hike with the need to pack food and water. He has his jeans rolled up above his ankles and chose to wear a tank top to manage the extremely high temperature. Although this rugged desert is full of dry mountains and cliffs, plenty of healthy green grass and bushes are sprouting up throughout the landscape. With only a few thin cirrus clouds running across the sky, the sunshine is able to fully burst over the peak on the very left, possibly reddening the rock surfaces more than they are already.",

The grass has been mown in even meter-wide stripes that alternate between shades of light and dark green.

Each one of the many windows adorning the exterior, as well as the doorways, are tall and arched. Across the top of the building are square parapets that lead to a pair of thin spires framing the main entrance. Six other spires and numerous chimneys extend up in the background, indicating just how gigantic this structure is. With only a smattering of stratus clouds, the day looks bright and gorgeous.",

The soft pure white edges of the walls and round domes, whose blue matches both sky and sea, give this structure's architecture a pleasant flow. The ornate cross atop the belfry, supported by four white columns, indicates that this is a place of worship for the Christian religion.

The paint of the buildings is primarily white with a few pastel red, yellow and blue scattered around.

Because most of the architecture has sharp cubic edges, the occasional round dome really stands out. As the city is quite vertical, numerous staircases line the tight spaces between the buildings, many of which have attractive patios with tables, umbrellas and canopies. The extremely narrow walkways make it impossible to have a street for cars here.

Both its paws are hanging out over the thin green cushion of the stool, making it look comfortable and relaxed. The stool itself is made of bamboo sticks tied together with a generous amount of twine. The sticks are arranged in a diagonal fashion, giving it a spiral appearance. Behind the cat, on a similar stool, sits a laptop that has been opened and plugged in by someone, perhaps this feline's owner.

Although no cars are currently driving, the tire tracks confirm that at least a couple vehicles have passed this way recently. The fact that all the cars are parked in the same direction, with hardly any available space between them, indicates this must be a one way street. The trees lined up between the cars and buildings are quite tall and spindly, their branches often intertwining with each other directly over the street. The buildings, likely residential apartments, are nearly an even split between being made of brick and concrete. That they reach no more than four or five stories in height means this neighborhood is probably not overcrowded.
